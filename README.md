# MatplotLib
Matplotlib is the most popular data visualization library for Python.

# Line Plotting-
The code seems self explanatory. Following steps were followed:

Define the x-axis and corresponding y-axis values as lists.
Plot them on canvas using .plot() function.
Give a name to x-axis and y-axis using .xlabel() and .ylabel() functions.
Give a title to your plot using .title() function.
Finally, to view your plot, we use .show() function.

As you can see, we have done several customizations like

setting the line-width, line-style, line-color.
setting the marker, marker’s face color, marker’s size.
